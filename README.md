## Description

This is a simple application build to learn more about how to use React Hooks and the React Context API. The application allows a User to keep track of an account balance, add positive "income" expenses, subtract "expense" expenditures using a simple form submission. It also keeps a running tab (or history) of both input and output transactions. Project uses React-Bootstrap for CSS styling. Additional functionality to come.
